Welcome to the 80s and its unbelievable technology! Write a program that behaves like a crappy awesome phonebook software. Please take some time to give your executable a relevant name. When the program starts, the user is prompted for input: you should accept the ADD command, the SEARCH command or the EXIT command. Any other input is discarded. To compile and test the program use this command:

Make re2
